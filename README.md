# Bioregional Knowledge Commoning

This repository is a shared workspace for **bioregional knowledge commoning** at multiple scales: foundational frameworks, interoperability patterns, and active pilot implementations.

## Purpose
- Build practical, federated approaches to bioregional knowledge sharing.
- Support ontological commoning and knowledge sovereignty.
- Incubate pilots that can inform broader commons infrastructure.

## Repository Structure
- `docs/foundations/` — reusable frameworks and methods.
- `pilots/` — active pilot planning and execution artifacts.
- `.github/` — collaboration templates for decisions and work items.

## Operations
- KOI federation runbook: `docs/foundations/koi-federation-operations-runbook.md`
- Discovery and peering are currently intro-based + explicit trust decisions (documented in the runbook).

## Active Pilot
- Front Range + Salish Sea + Cascadia: `pilots/front-range-cascadia-2026/`
- Pilot plan v2: `pilots/front-range-cascadia-2026/dual-bioregion-pilot-plan-v2.md`
- Pilot charter: `pilots/front-range-cascadia-2026/pilot-charter.md`

## Pilot Scaffold
- Regional pilot template: `pilots/template-regional-pilot/`
- Pilot index and startup steps: `pilots/README.md`

## Collaboration Workflow
1. Open an issue using `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
2. Propose changes via pull request.
3. For pilot decisions, log accepted decisions in the pilot decision log.
4. Use pilot review checklists for structured multi-steward review.
