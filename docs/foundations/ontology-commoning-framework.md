# Ontology Commoning Framework

## Purpose
Define how ontology mappings evolve through collective governance while respecting ontological pluriversality and knowledge sovereignty.

## Principles
1. Ontology as bridge, not imposed universal model.
2. Preserve source ontology and context even when mapping to commons layer.
3. Human-in-the-loop approval for mapping changes.
4. Explicit provenance and rationale for all mapping decisions.

## Mapping Lifecycle
1. Source profiling
- Identify fields, value types, and conventions.

2. Proposal generation
- Generate candidate mappings with confidence and notes.

3. Community review
- Co-stewards and invited reviewers evaluate mappings.

4. Decision
- Approve, reject, or mark `proposed_extension`.

5. Publication
- Apply approved mappings in interoperable contracts.

6. Re-evaluation
- Periodic review based on new sources and pilot findings.

## Mapping Types
- `equivalent`
- `narrower`
- `broader`
- `related`
- `unmapped`
- `proposed_extension`

## Governance Rules
- No automatic publication of unreviewed mappings.
- Unmapped concepts are preserved and visible for ontology evolution.
- Sensitive/Indigenous knowledge mappings require consent checks before cross-node publication.

## Outputs
- Mapping decisions and rationale in the relevant pilot decision log and mapping artifacts.
- Current pilot default: `pilots/front-range-cascadia-2026/decision-log.md`.
- Versioned mapping policy updates in pull requests with reviewer sign-off.
