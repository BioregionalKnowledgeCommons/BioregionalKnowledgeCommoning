# Docs

This folder is the documentation index for the Bioregional Knowledge Commoning repository.

## Start Here
- [Foundations index](./foundations/README.md): all reusable cross-pilot frameworks.
- [Pattern language v0.1](./foundations/pattern-language-for-bioregional-knowledge-commoning-v0.1.md): recurring social and governance design patterns.
- [Meta-protocol v0.1](./foundations/knowledge-commoning-meta-protocol-v0.1.md): thin interoperability commitments.
- [CommonsChange reference profile v0.1](./foundations/commonschange-reference-profile-v0.1.md): one implementable profile for exchange.
- [Bioregion onboarding playbook](./foundations/bioregion-onboarding-playbook.md): single-node-first and swarm-from-start setup tracks.

## Foundations Documents
- [Pattern language](./foundations/pattern-language-for-bioregional-knowledge-commoning-v0.1.md): pattern set for participation, consent boundaries, bridges, and holonic nesting.
- [Meta-protocol](./foundations/knowledge-commoning-meta-protocol-v0.1.md): invariant requirements (`what`, `who attests`, `who can use/how`) plus conformance levels.
- [CommonsChange profile](./foundations/commonschange-reference-profile-v0.1.md): event/snapshot exchange format used as an optional reference implementation.
- [Node participation profiles](./foundations/node-participation-profiles.md): non-KOI, KOI full, and KOI gateway/partial operational options.
- [Holonic swarm reference architecture](./foundations/holonic-swarm-reference-architecture.md): nested coordinator and boundary rules.
- [Rights/licensing/consent slots](./foundations/rights-licensing-consent-policy-slots.md): required policy metadata slots without universal value mandates.
- [Bioregion onboarding playbook](./foundations/bioregion-onboarding-playbook.md): 30/60/90 day onboarding and readiness gates.
- [Ontology commoning framework](./foundations/ontology-commoning-framework.md): mapping lifecycle and governance for ontology evolution.
- [Transcription and processing pipeline](./foundations/transcription-and-processing-pipeline.md): consent-aware interview-to-mapping workflow.
- [KOI federation operations runbook](./foundations/koi-federation-operations-runbook.md): operational KOI peering and troubleshooting procedures.

## Legacy Compatibility Stubs

- [dual-bioregion-pilot-plan-v2.md](./dual-bioregion-pilot-plan-v2.md): moved to pilot folder.
- [open-questions.md](./open-questions.md): moved to pilot folder.
- [pilot-charter.md](./pilot-charter.md): moved to pilot folder.
