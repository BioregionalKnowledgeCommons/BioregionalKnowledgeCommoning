# Open Questions

## For Benjamin Review
1. Should Cascadia have any additional governance-specific constraints beyond standard coordinator policy?
2. Which minimum entity types should be in scope for first public demo (all five or subset)?
3. What review SLA is acceptable for shared-field conflict queue items?
4. Should bridge mappings live only in contracts repo or duplicated per node with generated sync?
5. Which public narrative/demo audience is primary: practitioners, funders, or technical collaborators?

## Implementation-Blocking Questions
1. Confirm Benjamin's GitHub username for reviewer assignment and CODEOWNERS setup.
2. Confirm first Front Range data source for seed ingestion.
3. Confirm whether pilot metrics dashboard will be in Grafana or lightweight API endpoint only.
