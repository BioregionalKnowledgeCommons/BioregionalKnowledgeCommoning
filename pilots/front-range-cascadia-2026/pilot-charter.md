# Pilot Charter

## Name
Dual Bioregion Interop Pilot: Front Range + Salish Sea + Cascadia

## Objective
Prove that multiple bioregions can exchange useful knowledge with sovereignty protections through a dual-canonical architecture where KOI is optional and interoperability is contract-driven.

## Timebox
- Start: 2026-02-11
- Duration: 8 weeks
- End target: 2026-04-08

## Participants (Equal Co-Stewards)
- Darren Zal: Co-Steward
- Benjamin Life: Co-Steward
- Shawn Anderson: Co-Steward
- Cascadia/front-range/salish-sea node stewards: operational owners

## Scope
- Build and run cross-bioregion exchange for selected entity types.
- Stand up Cascadia as live full node.
- Enable Front Range participation without requiring KOI runtime.
- Integrate transcription -> processing -> ontology mapping workflow for BKC project alignment.
- Run public demo with provenance traceability.

## Non-Goals
- Full production hardening across all bioregions.
- Obsidian Sync based transport.
- Full Murmurations protocol interoperability.

## Success Metrics
- p95 sync latency < 120s
- 0 consent policy violations
- Conflict queue resolution SLA <= 2 business days
- At least one end-to-end demo scenario completed publicly
- At least one interview transcript processed through mapping workflow with consent metadata

## Governance
- All major decisions logged in `pilots/front-range-cascadia-2026/decision-log.md`.
- Major architecture/governance decisions require 2-of-3 co-steward approval.
- Contract/schema changes require review from at least two co-stewards.
- Consent policy changes require explicit decision issue sign-off.
- Weekly facilitation rotates among Darren, Benjamin, and Shawn.
