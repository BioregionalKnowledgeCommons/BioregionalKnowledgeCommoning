# Open Questions

## For Co-Steward Review
1. Which interview cohorts should be prioritized first for transcription/mapping in the 8-week window?
2. Which shared fields require stricter validation rules before pilot launch (`entity_type`, `bioregion`, slug, others)?
3. Should restricted consent tier include a time-bound review policy for eventual reclassification?
4. Do we need a separate ethics or sovereignty review checkpoint before public demo publication?
5. Should map/table interface updates happen in pilot or be deferred to post-pilot execution?

## Implementation-Blocking Questions
1. Confirm Benjamin's and Shawn's GitHub usernames for reviewer assignment and CODEOWNERS setup.
2. Confirm first Front Range non-KOI data source and storage pattern.
3. Confirm transcription tooling stack and budget constraints for the first interviews.
