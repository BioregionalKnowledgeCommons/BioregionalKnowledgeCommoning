# Open Questions

## For Co-Steward Review
1. Which interview cohorts should be prioritized first for transcription/mapping in the 8-week window?
2. Which shared fields require stricter validation rules before pilot launch (`canonical_type`, `bioregion`, slug, others)?
3. Should restricted consent tier include a time-bound review policy for eventual reclassification?
4. Do we need a separate ethics or sovereignty review checkpoint before public demo publication?
5. Should map/table interface updates happen in pilot or be deferred to post-pilot execution?
6. Should Front Range start with snapshot mode only, or support both snapshot and event in phase 1?
7. What default policy should Cascadia apply for external queries when sub-node consent differs?

## Implementation-Blocking Questions
1. Confirm Benjamin's and Shawn's GitHub usernames for reviewer assignment and CODEOWNERS setup.
2. Confirm first Front Range non-KOI data source and storage pattern.
3. Confirm transcription tooling stack and budget constraints for the first interviews.
4. Confirm initial participation profile for Front Range (`non-koi`, `koi-gateway`, or `koi-full`).
5. Confirm initial consent slot vocabulary values for pilot use (local governance-approved).
