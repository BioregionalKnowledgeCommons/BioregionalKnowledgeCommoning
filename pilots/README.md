# Pilots

This directory contains active and scaffolded pilot workstreams.

## Active
- `front-range-cascadia-2026/` — active pilot planning and execution docs.

## Scaffold
- `template-regional-pilot/` — template for launching a new regional pilot.

## How to Start a New Pilot
1. Copy `template-regional-pilot/` to a new folder named with geography + year (example: `great-lakes-2026/`).
2. Select a participation profile using `../docs/foundations/node-participation-profiles.md`.
3. Fill `pilot-charter.md`, `pilot-plan.md`, and `tooling-and-authority-map.md` first.
4. Define consent boundary defaults and rights/consent slot values before cross-node exchange.
5. Log all material decisions in that pilot's `decision-log.md`.
6. Add the new pilot to this index and to the root `README.md`.
